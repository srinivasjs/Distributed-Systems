Celery is a Distributed System to process vast amounts of messages. It is a Task Queue, that also supports Task Scheduling

Task Queue:

A Task Queue distributes work across multiple threads/machines . A Task Queue takes in a unit of work called Task .
Dedicated Worker Processes constantly monitor Task Queues for new work to perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a Broker such as RabbitMQ . A client adds message (a unit of Work), 
which the Broker delivers it to a Worker

A Celery system can contain multiple Brokers and Workers supporting High Availibility and Horizontal Scaling .

Note : Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources. (Source WIKI)

Celery can run on a single machine, or multiple machines, or even across Data Centers

Clients and Workers will automatically retry in case of Failures/ connection loss thus enabling HA . Brokers, such
as RabbitMQ support HA in the form of Master/Master or Master/Slave Replication
